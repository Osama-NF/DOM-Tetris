movement:
	4 Function for that, all apply to a (.moveable) class:

		1- dropBlock() is a recursive function that takes the block 
		and makes it fall (with the speed the player chooses).
		stops on two conditions: hit the bottom border, or it's bottom hit
		another block.
		
		2- moveBlock(dir) is a function that takes the direction
		(right or left) and move to that direction.
		doesn't move on one conditions: the required direction is blocked
		by the walls of the field

		3- rotateBlock(dir) is a function that takes the direction of the rotating,
		and checks the current state of the block, and change the class accordingly.

		4- controlBlockSpeed(speed) is a function that changes the speed
		while players is holding the button (up or down), and calls this function
		again when player releases it.
		expected value for parameter: 
			1= more speed
			2= slower
			0= revert back (is always the parameter when the player releases the button)
